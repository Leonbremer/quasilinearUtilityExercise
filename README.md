This GitHub repo is to host an exercise for a course I teach. The course is Environmental and Resource Economics to master students at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam.

The exercise is on quasilinear utility functions. This repo provides visualizations to this type of utility functions, including visual solutions and policy analysis.
